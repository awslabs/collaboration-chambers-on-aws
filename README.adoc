== :rocket: How to install Scale-Out Computing on AWS

Refer to https://awslabs.github.io/scale-out-computing-on-aws/tutorials/install-soca-cluster/[https://awslabs.github.io/scale-out-computing-on-aws/tutorials/install-soca-cluster/] for installation instructions.

=== 1-Click installer

Visit https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/scale-out-computing-on-aws[https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/scale-out-computing-on-aws]

:warning:1-Click installer is great for PoC or demos. For production workload, it's recommended to go with "Custom Build" instead.


=== Custom Build

. Clone this git repository
+
```bash
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/scale-out-computing-on-aws
```

. Run the following command to create your build (support Python2 and Python3):
+
```bash
STACK_NAME=<your-stack-name>
python source/manual_build.py \
    --region <region> \
    --bucket <deployment-bucket> \
    [ --client-ip <CIDR-with-access-to-VPC> ] \
    [ --prefix-list-id <prefix-list-with-access-to-VPC> ] \
    --ssh-keypair <keypair> \
    --username <username> \
    --stack-name $STACK_NAME \
    --password <ssm-parameter-with password> \
    --id $STACK_NAME \
    --create
```

. Output will be created under `source/dist/<build_id>`

. Upload `source/dist/<build_id>` folder to your own S3 bucket

. Launch CloudFormation and use `scale-out-computing-on-aws.template` as base template

Refer to https://awslabs.github.io/scale-out-computing-on-aws/install-soca-cluster/[https://awslabs.github.io/scale-out-computing-on-aws/install-soca-cluster/] for installation instructions.

== :pencil2: File Structure
Scale-Out Computing on AWS project consists in a collection of CloudFormation templates, Shell scripts and Python code.
